		<p>     The Gunners' started their Champions League campaign with a 2-1 defeat in Croatia thanks to an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain own goal and a second-half Junior Fernandes header, while striker Olivier Giroud was sent off in the first half for two bookable offences.</p>

		<marquee> one question for you? what are those..............footballers </marquee>
		<p>Giroud's red card was silly</p>
		<p>The second yellow card was a soft one, but he was arguing with the referee after the first one. You're away from home, walk away.</p>
		
		<p>"You've bundles of experience. Why do you want to get involved in this little mish-mash with a referee because he ain't going to listen or pay attention to you? He finds that you're being childish, so stop it."</p>

		<p>"He ended up red-carding him because of a clumsy, silly little soft free-kick."</p>

		<p>Wenger made six changes to the team that beat Stoke in the Premier League on Saturday, but former Arsenal striker Nicholas said the likes of Giroud, David Ospina, Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy did little to convince him they should be playing more regularly </p>
		<span> who do blame for the loss? </span>

		Olympiakos had never won in England before. The camera picks out a couple of seething Arsenal fans. The rest of them look bemused and well they might. Their team has done it again. Arsenal were complacent. They were flat. There was a lack of urgency. They were a little unlucky at times but you cannot expect to be this careless at this level and get away with it. The first goal was a collective shambles, the second a nightmare for David Ospina, the decisive third from Alfred Finnbogason a dozy disgrace given that Arsenal had just equalised.</p>

		<p>Arsene Wenger said that Arsenal could not afford to drop points tonight. They have dropped points. They have dropped three points and after two games of their Champions League campaign, they are bottom of their group with zero points following chaotic defeats against Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiakos. Their next two games are against Bayern Munich, who won 5-0 tonight. They’re probably going to need to get something against the German giants. It’s never simple with this lot, is it? Thanks for reading and emailing. Night.</p>
